# Audio Signal Analysis in Python

A curated collection of Python scripts, Jupyter notebooks, and resources for analyzing and processing audio signals using libraries such as Librosa, FFT, convolution, and more.

## About

This repository demonstrates the fundamentals and advanced techniques of audio signal analysis and processing in Python. Explore waveform analysis, spectral features, filtering, transformations, and creative audio effects using popular Python libraries.

## Topics & Tools

- **Librosa**: Audio loading, feature extraction, visualization
- **FFT (Fast Fourier Transform)**: Spectral analysis, filtering, and transformations
- **Convolution**: Audio filtering, effects, and system response
- **Other Libraries**: NumPy, SciPy, Matplotlib, SoundFile
- **Audio Features**: MFCC, chroma, spectral centroid, zero-crossing rate, etc.
- **Visualization**: Waveforms, spectrograms, frequency-domain plots
